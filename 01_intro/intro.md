# ML Ops - Introduction

## The three steps of ML Ops

01. Design: Is machine learning necessary for our project?
If the answer is yes we go to the next step.

02. Train: We try to find the best possible model.

03. Operate: Once we have the model, we deploy it

## Preparing the environment: Github codespaces
