# MLOPS Model Monitoring

## 1.0 Introduction to Model Monitoring - Key Insights


- **üß© Layered Approach to Monitoring ML Services:** Traditional service monitoring (uptime, latency) alone is insufficient for ML models. Adding layers that track model performance, data integrity, and drift offers a comprehensive view of the system‚Äôs health and reliability. This multi-faceted approach reduces blind spots and allows early detection of degradation.

- **üìâ Data and Concept Drift as Early Warning Signals:** Since models interact with changing environments, shifts in data distribution (`data drift`) or target function behavior (`concept drift`) can predict performance drops before ground truth is available. Monitoring these drifts helps prevent prolonged periods of degraded model output, enhancing model lifecycle management.

- **‚è≥ Mitigating Ground Truth Latency with Proxy Metrics:** Ground truth labels often arrive with delays, making real-time error metrics impossible. Incorporating proxy signals, such as data quality or distribution checks, enables quicker identification of input anomalies and indirect signs of model issues, managing risks effectively.

- **‚öñÔ∏è Fairness and Bias Monitoring for Sensitive Domains:** In areas with high ethical stakes (healthcare, finance), monitoring model bias and fairness is crucial. This prevents harmful disparate impacts and supports regulatory compliance. ***Segmenting metrics by user groups or categories enables granular insight into model behavior across diverse populations.***

- **üîÑ Integration of Batch and Online Monitoring for Realistic ML Operations:** Pure real-time monitoring can be impractical for complex metrics like drift detection, which require distributional comparisons. Combining real-time checks with batch-windowed evaluations balances responsiveness and analytical depth, making monitoring feasible for streaming or API-based models.

- **üè¢ Leveraging Existing Company Monitoring Infrastructures:** Many organizations already have production monitoring frameworks (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, BI tools). Adapting these for ML model monitoring conserves resources and accelerates adoption. Starting with simpler batch analysis using BI dashboards can provide immediate value before introducing more sophisticated automation.

- **üõ†Ô∏è Building a Generalizable and Modular Monitoring Pipeline:** The architecture outlined (logging, batch metrics computation, database storage, dashboard visualization) is decoupled and flexible. It supports diverse model types, varying deployment modes, and evolving monitoring needs. Using open-source tools like Evidently AI reduces development effort and ensures robust, reproducible monitoring.
